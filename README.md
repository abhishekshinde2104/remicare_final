# Remicare Medicine Intake Tracker
Android application using Flutter and Firebase which sent an automated reminder to patients to take their medication on time. 

A unique feature of the project was it stored the previous health records and prescriptions, lab tests reports, etc on the cloud and the user could retrieve these documents later for reference. 

Doctorsâ€™ assistance was a module of the project where the patients could have their trivial doubts cleared by qualified doctors by an online chat platform. 

The motive behind this project was to bring about a change in society and help patients which could be an advantage amidst the Covid-19 pandemic.
